          message: "Invalid includes directive: %{klass}.includes(%{args})"
          summary: "Eager loading in Mongoid only supports providing arguments
            to %{klass}.includes that are the names of relations on the %{klass}
            model."
          resolution: "Ensure that each parameter passed to %{klass}.includes is
            a valid name of a relation on the %{klass} model. These are: %{relations}."

        invalid_polymorphic_nested_includes:
          message: "Invalid nested include directive: %{klass}.includes(%{args}, from: %{from}), %{from}
            is a polymorphic relation."
          summary: "Given that %{from} is a polymorphic relation, you must specify
            :from_class when calling the method to resolve the ambiguity."
          resolution: "Ensure that the first parameter passed to %{klass}.includes is
            a non-polymorphic relation in the %{klass} model, or a explicit class in :from_class"
